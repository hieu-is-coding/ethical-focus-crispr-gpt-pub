CRISPR-GPT is an innovative Large Language Model (LLM) agent designed to automate and streamline the process of designing gene-editing experiments. By leveraging the power of advanced language models, CRISPR-GPT assists researchers in planning, executing, and analyzing CRISPR-based gene editing tasks with unprecedented efficiency and accuracy.

## CRISPR-GPT Architecture

<img width="830" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56f830b8-a434-4fba-b9c4-ea54e0495f15">

The backbone of CRISPR-GPT involves multi-agent collaboration between four core components: 

(1) **LLM Planner Agent** is responsible for configuring tasks, it automatically performs task decomposition and planning based on the userâ€™s request.

(2) **Task Executor Agent** implements the chain of state machines from the Planner Agent, and is responsible for providing instructions, feedback, receiving input from User-Proxy Agent, and calling Tool Provider agent.

(3) **LLM User-Proxy Agent** is responsible for interacting with the Task Executor on behalf of the user, where the user can monitor the process and provide corrections to the User-Proxy Agent.

(4) **Tool Providers** support diverse external tools and connect to search engines or databases via API calls.


## CRISPR-GPT Supports 4 Gene-editing Scenarios with 3 User Modes

CRISPR-GPT supports four primary gene-editing modalities: **knockout**, **base-editing**, **prime-editing**, **epigenetic editing**, and offers three user interaction modes:

(1) **Meta mode**: Step-by-Step Guidance on Pre-defined Gene-editing Meta-Tasks

(2) **Auto mode**: Customized Guidance on Free-style User Requests

(3) **QA mode**: Real-time Answers on Ad Hoc Questions

## Roadmap

We are committed to continuously improving CRISPR-GPT and expanding its capabilities. Our roadmap includes:



- **Support for New CRISPR Methods and Workflows**: examples include Cas13-based RNA-editing.
- **Improved LLM via User/Expert Feedback**: Enhancing AI performance through fine-tuning with larger datasets, your expertise and feedback needed so please sign up for testing CRISPR-GPT as noted above.
- **User Interface Upgrades**: Creating a more intuitive and customizable front end for managing experiments.
- **Integration with Lab Automation**: Facilitating hands-on execution of experiments using robotics and lab automation tools.
- **Integration with Lab Notebook**: Developing APIs for integration with existing laboratory information management systems (LIMS).

We value user feedback and will be actively incorporating suggestions from the research community to make CRISPR-GPT an indispensable tool in gene editing research.
