Sorry, we could not find a sgRNA for you in our database. 

While we could suggest some great resources and/or some online tools to help you design the sgRNA for your application:

1. You could use sgRNAs that have been validated. Here is Addgene's validated sgRNA database:
https://www.addgene.org/crispr/reference/grna-sequence/

2. You could use some online tools. Incluidng:
(i) CRISPRpick: https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gppx/crispick/public (Kim et al.,Nat Biotechnol.,2018;DeWeirdt et al.,Nat Biotechnol.,2021;Doench et al.,Nat Biotechnol.,2016;Sanson et al.,Nat Commun, 2018)
